## Supported micro-controller(s)

Currently supported micro-controller(s):

* Atmega8
* Atmega168

Adding support for other micro-controllers should be easy, as long as the target has enough
IO pins and enough memory (flash and SRAM).

For N64 and Gamecube controller compatiblity, the micro-controller must be clocked at 12 MHz.
